	   <p> (1) Demonstration of electronic vehicle having automated speed control by detecting close obstacles. The equipments use are Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, Ultarsonic Sensor, IR transmitter and Receiver. The ultarsonic sensor helps to detect close obstacles. The signal is received by the arduino as input and accordingly it sets the speed of the motor</p>

		   <p> Radio Controlled Aircraft with wing folding mechanism. Clark YM-15 airfoil was chosen for the aircraft wing. The Propulsion system was single tractor (Motor Emax BL 4030 with Propeller size 16x8).Coefficient of lift / Coefficient of Drag vs angle of attack curves were obtained for Clark YM-15 using various turbulence modeling in ANSYS. Balsa wood was used as the main structural material.  </p>

<h3> 1. Here I developed a code that can determine the deflection rate of a cantilever beam (Length L) subjected to a point load P at the free end. The user have to input the applied load P, Length L,Modulus of elasticity and Number of division. The deflection at the free end will be calculated by numerical integration method. The output will give the deflection rate at each nodal point. <h3>

<h3> 2. Here I developed a code that can solve the 2nd order differential equation by finite difference method. In this case, governing equation of conductive heat transfer has been used to demonstrate. 
	The user have to input the number of division of the conductor and number of iteration. The output will show the final temperature of the conductor at each nodal point. </h3>
