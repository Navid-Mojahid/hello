<h2> Effect of Carbon Nanoparticles on the Mechanical Properties of Banana Fiber-Reinforced Polymer Composite</h2>
<p> Abstract—Natural fiber-reinforced composites, at present, are having a significant role to meet the challenge of developing materials of high strength to weight ratio for the application in the field of automotive and aerospace. In this research, the effect of carbon nanotube (CNT) as filler material in banana fiber reinforced polymer has been studied by incorporating carbon nanotube and banana fiber with epoxy resin in different weight ratios. The materials were prepared by the hand layup process. Two cases were considered for the study where the sum of weight percentage of fiber and filler in the composite were kept 8% for the first case and 16% for the second one. The experimental results showed remarkable improvement in the tensile and flexural properties of the composite due to the addition of carbon nanotubes. The tensile strength increased by 11.33% for the addition of 1.5% of CNT in the first case and 13.29% for the addition of 2.5% of CNT in the second case. 
	On the other hand, flexural strength increased by 71.5% and 123% respectively for adding CNT of stated weight percentage <p>.

<h2> Design and Fabrication of a Radio Controlled Aircraft Having Wing Folding Mechanism and Payload Dropping System </h2> 
	<p> The project was submitted to the American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics (AIAA) Design/Build/Fly (DBF) competition, held in TMPA field at Tucson, AZ. The supreme objective of the team is to design an aircraft that fulfills all the requirements while maximizing the competition score based on the provided score equations which are listed in rule book of the corresponding year. Main concern while determining the design was the folding wing mechanism and short take-off within 10x4 ft ramp which is inclined at 5 degree. </p>
	<p> Clark YM-15 airfoil was chosen for the aircraft wing. The Propulsion system was single tractor 
	(Motor Emax BL 4030 with Propeller size 16x8).Coefficient of lift / Coefficient of Drag vs angle of attack curves were obtained for Clark YM-15 using various 
		turbulence modeling in ANSYS. Balsa wood was used as the main structural material. </P>

<h2> Demonstration of electronic vehicle having automated speed control by detecting close obstacles</h2>
<p> The equipments use are Arduino Uno, Arduino Nano, Ultarsonic Sensor, IR transmitter and Receiver. The ultarsonic sensor helps to detect close obstacles. 
	The signal is received by the arduino as input and accordingly it sets the speed of the motor </p>

<h3> 1. Here I developed a code that can determine the deflection rate of a cantilever beam (Length L) subjected to a point load P at the free end. The user have to input the applied load P, Length L,Modulus of elasticity and Number of division. The deflection at the free end will be calculated by numerical integration method. The output will give the deflection rate at each nodal point. <h3>
